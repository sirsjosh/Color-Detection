# Color Detection using Webcam

![Alt Text](https://github.com/sirsjosh/Color-Detection/blob/main/cover.jpg)

## Overview

This project is a simple color recognition system using OpenCV and Python. The system detects a specific color (in this case, yellow) in a video stream, draws a bounding box around the detected region, and displays the result in real-time.

## Features

- Color detection: The system identifies a specified color in the video stream.
- Real-time visualization: The detected region is highlighted with a green bounding box in the live video feed.
- Adjustable color: You can easily configure the system to detect a different color by changing the RGB values.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-recognition.git
   cd color-recognition
